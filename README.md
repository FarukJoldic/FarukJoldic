## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Software Engineering student with a keen interest in frontend development. I enjoy building interactive and user-friendly web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular, and I have hands-on experience with Three.js and Ionic for creating engaging interfaces and cross-platform apps.

For the past 1.5 years, I've been diving into the world of Game Development, exploring creative possibilities with Unity and Unreal Engine. My hard work is culminating in an exciting project that's soon to be launchedâ€”feel free to check it out right here on my GitHub!
